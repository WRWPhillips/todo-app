# README

This is an initial attempt at a CRUD application made with rails, something 
I haven't worked with before. 

I've mostly worked off of 
[this](https://medium.com/@nancydo7/ruby-on-rails-crud-tutorial-899117710c7a) 
medium article, although it's incomplete so I'm doing research on my own as
well.

I have many things left to do, and as of now this project is incomplete!

Goals include:

- [ ] Finish endpoints and basic CRUD layout.
- [ ] Learn how to style website with Ruby.
- [ ] Incorporate more advanced react with multiple components being rendered.
- [ ] Research more about the way Rails is sending down HTML/CSS/JS.
- [ ] Host this website once it is completely finished.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
